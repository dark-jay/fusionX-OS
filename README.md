# fusionX-OS
fusionX-OS is my Diploma final year semester project where I have created a very simple Kernel with a command line interface, which can actually boot on a intel-x86 machine. 

# Reference:
Reference that I have used to make this project are:
###### - https://wiki.osdev.org
###### - Youtube Channel: [Write your own Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQdZltW7bh1ta-_nCH7LWYw).

# Purpose of the project:
The entire project is created with just one goal in mind, to kick Microsoft and Apple out of their OS business: Just Kidding, I have made the project just to learn the underlying concept of how a OS works, specially the Kernel. But what I have created is not just a proof of concept, it can actually be extensible.

# How to Compile:
Comming soon...
